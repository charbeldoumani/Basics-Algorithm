//Pseudocode:
//1- Define a variable X as an array.
//2- For loop the lenght of the variable X.
//3- Define the variable i inside the for loop.
//4- Print the result as requested: X = [1,4,2,12]

//Code:
var X=[1,4,2,12];
for(var i =0; i<X.length; i++){
  console.log(X[i]);
}

//Diagram:
//i=0 ==> X = [1]
//i=1 ==> X = [1,4]
//i=2 ==> X = [1,4,2]
//i=3 ==> X = [1,4,2,12]
